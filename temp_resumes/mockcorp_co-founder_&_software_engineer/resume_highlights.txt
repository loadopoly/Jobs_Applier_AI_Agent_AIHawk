KEY TALKING POINTS FOR YOUR INTERVIEW:

  1. Use role-specific keywords from the job posting in your experience
     bullets.
  2. Quantify outcomes in operations/supply chain terms (cost, cycle time,
     fill rate).
  3. Place the exact role title in your headline if it matches your target
     role.

============================================================
TIP: Practice each point with a STAR story (Situation, Task,
     Action, Result) before your interview.
